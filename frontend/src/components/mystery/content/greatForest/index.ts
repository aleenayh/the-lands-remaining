		intro: [
			"You have heard whispers of a place where flowers once grew to overflowing abundance, where the Fae danced beneath lantern-lit bowers, and mortal poets wept to see such beauty. They called it the Rose Court, a garden-realm ruled by Lady Cenduwain—a sovereign of grace, wit, and wonder, whose footsteps created trails of sweet blossoms.",
			"That was before the Dimning. Before the roses blackened and split under the first touch of bloom rot. Before the garden sank into a choking mire of stagnant water and rotting petals.",
			"Before Lady Cenduwain became the thing now known as the Putrescent Queen.",
			"The stories say she sits at the swamp’s heart, attended by the diseased remains of her court. They say her beauty withered to madness, her laughter curdled to a wet, rasping croon. She is too powerful to approach directly, too broken to reason with, and too rooted in sorrow to leave her throne of thorns and muck.",
			"Yet there is one tale—old, uncertain, half-forgotten—that may offer a path. When the Dimning came, Cenduwain did not fall to shadow. She fell to grief. She lost the one she loved, and in that loss her heart unraveled. If the tale is true, then to reach her—to stand close enough to survive her terrible power—you must uncover the truth of that lost love. You must learn who they were, what they looked like, their story… and wear it like a mask to the heart of the swamp.",
